Hello, I'm Ope Ojo


I am a cybersecurity professional specialising in Security Operations (SOC) and Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC), focused on detecting and responding to threats while helping organisations align with industry frameworks such as ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and the ACSC Essential Eight.
My goal is to combine hands-on SOC skills (detection, investigation, incident response) with strong governance and risk practices to reduce cyber risk in real-world environments.

Completed - CyberNova Academy -100% Hands-On Cohort Training:(Cybersecurity SOC & GRC)
CyberNova Academy’s SOC & GRC Cohort is 100% hands-on, job-ready program designed to help learners build real SOC analyst capability (detection, triage, investigation, response) and GRC capability (risk, compliance, ISO 27001, Essential Eight alignment, audit readiness).

Learners graduate with:

A GitHub portfolio with practical SOC labs and write-ups.
Evidence of detection engineering (KQL/SPL, dashboards, alerts, use cases).
Incident response workflow experience (tickets, cases, playbooks, reports).
GRC artifacts (risk register, policies, ISMS scope, audit evidence pack).
Real-world tooling familiarity (SIEM (Splunk, Wazuh, Microsoft Sentinel), EDR/XDR ( Defender for Endpoint, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike), SOAR (Splunk Soar/Microsoft Sentinel Soar), threat intel, Vulnerability Management Tools (Tenable, Rapid 7 and Open VAS).
About Firstname Lastname , SOC & GRC Professional
As a SOC and GRC-focused cybersecurity professional, I work at the intersection of technical detection/response and governance-driven risk management. My interests include building SOC workflows, designing detections in SIEM platforms, and creating governance artifacts that map security controls to business risk and compliance requirements.

What I focus on:

Hands-on SOC skills: log analysis, alert triage, threat hunting, and incident response in enterprise-style environments.
GRC capability: risk assessments, control design, ISO 27001 and Essential Eight alignment, policy and audit preparation.
Career development: building a strong portfolio on GitHub, documenting labs clearly, and continuously improving technical and governance skills.

Objective
My objective is to build a career as a SOC and GRC professional, contributing to detection, response, and governance in modern enterprises. I am particularly interested in Tier 1/Tier 2 SOC analyst roles and junior GRC analyst roles where I can apply detection engineering, incident handling, and risk management to help organisations strengthen their security posture.
